# XLSX Unlocker

Usage:

Download the script and execute it by doing either:
    Right-click -> Run with Powershell
    Or running it directly from the terminal

```powershell
.\xlsx-unlocker.ps1 # Allows you to select from window dialog
```
```powershell
.\xlsx-unlocker -InputPath "yourfile.xlsx"
```

Outputs will be relative to the script, so it's recommended to place the script in its own folder. Your unlocked_myfile.xlsx will be placed in the same directory as the script.
